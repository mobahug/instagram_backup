after logged in can have access to:


			like other users picture,

			we still have to modify the homePage to become the indexPage
			and for the current index page give a login name


		***********BUGG TO SOLVE WITH PROPER INNER JOIN tables*************


			if another user don t have profilepicture (lets say deleting)

			his/her name will change to that one who has profile picture

		************BUG********

		only 1 profile picture can be not more
		(with LIMIT could solve the output issue)
		There is still issue about to upload and store in the folder the profile picture

		also during registration now if there is something wrong, its still saving into the database the email stuff


		FINISH LATER USERUPDATE UI BUGFIX!!!
